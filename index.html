        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p> Last updated: April 2, 2023</p>
        <p>Thank you for choosing Time Balance. We prioritize your privacy and are committed to being transparent about
            our data collection, use, and sharing practices. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data while
            you use Time Balance.</p>
        <h2>Our commitment to privacy</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any information that can personally identify our users. Instead, we only collect anonymous
            data, which helps us address technical issues, track purchases, and determine how to improve the app for
            everyone.</p>
        <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymized data, such as crash reports, device
            types, and aggregated statistics related to the core features of the app. This data helps us identify and
            fix bugs, as well as enhance app features. You can find more information about both services here:<br>
            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>
        </p>
        <p>RevenueCat is used for anonymous purchase tracking. When a purchase occurs, we only have access to the
            purchase details, such as the product that was purchased, the timestamp and the country; no other data is
            collected, ensuring that purchase information cannot be linked to a user's identity. More information about
            RevenueCat is available here:<br>
            <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/</a>
        </p>
        <p>All your personal data, including projects, tasks, and tags, are stored locally on your device, ensuring that
            we cannot access this data.</p>
        <h2>Sharing information and user responsibility</h2>
        <p>Time Balance lets you export and share your data, such as projects, time tracking sessions and tasks. This is
            helpful for making backups or moving to a new device. However, we are not responsible for the protection of
            any data that you choose to share or export from the app. It is your responsibility to ensure the protection
            of such data, and we encourage you to only share your data through channels you trust.</p>
        <h2>Your consent</h2>
        <p>By using Time Balance, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>
        <h2>Updates to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may make changes to this privacy policy, which will be posted here. Please visit this page
            regularly to stay informed about any updates.</p>
